## Project description
Mom's movies is a one stop shop for picking a movie. Our application will allow the user to search by genre, decade, and by rating
we plan to display 5 movie titles as search results then go into greater detail about each movie. we want to add a scrolling featture so when you click on each movie title it brings you to some more in depth information about it.
example of the format each movie will be in
Movie title
TMDB information: genre, rating, description, popularity
rotten tomatoes information
then we will display either a preview or a gif depending on how difficult the implementation is of each.
